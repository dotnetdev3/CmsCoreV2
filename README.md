# CmsCoreV2
.NET Core Multi-Tenant CMS

We are recreating CmsCore using multi-tenant single layer architecture. We didn't use Onion Architecture, because it is decreasing productivity.

Single layer makes possible to use Visual Studio 2017 controller templates when creating controllers and views. Thanks to Visual Studio.
